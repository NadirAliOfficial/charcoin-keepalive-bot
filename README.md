# charcoin-keepalive-bot
A lightweight Python bot that ensures CharCoin always stays active on Dexscreener by automatically executing a tiny ($0.50â€“$1.00) daily buy if no transactions occur in the past 24 hours. Prevents graphs and API data in the DAPP from disappearing without relying on costly third-party APIs like Birdeye.
